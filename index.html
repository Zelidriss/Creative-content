            <h2>Title : A rabbit named benny</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a little rabbit named Benny. He was no ordinary rabbit. Benny had magical powers. The forest animals had a deep respect for him as Benny always helped those in need with his magic powers.

                One day, Benny was hopping around the forest, minding his own business when he saw a little bird crying. Benny approached the bird and asked, "What's wrong little one?" With teary eyes, the bird said, "My nest has fallen apart due to the fierce wind, and my eggs are out in the open, and I cannot move them."
                
                Benny immediately used his powers to fix the bird's nest, making it stronger than ever. The bird was overjoyed and thanked Benny for his help.
                
                As Benny continued his walk, he saw a group of mice running around in panic. They were trying to escape from an owl who was chasing them. Benny quickly thought of a way to save the mice. He created a thick fog, which made it difficult for the owl to see. The mice used this opportunity to run away and hide safely.
                
                Later that day, Benny reached home tired from all his magical work. He poured some water in a little pond near his house and cooled himself down. The animals of the forest had always been grateful to Benny for his help, and they thought of doing something special for him. They held a surprise party for Benny, which included berries, fruits, and a lot of fun and games.
                
                Benny was touched by this thoughtful gesture and was thankful for their friendship. With a content heart, Benny went to sleep.
                
                From that day onwards, Benny became one of the most renowned and loved animals in the forest, and nobody ever forgot the good deeds he had done.
                
                Moral of the story - Kindness and good deeds never go unnoticed.
